### An experimental minigame based off of the famous Google Dinosaur Game, featuring art and animations by myself! (WIP)  

I started this project, after completing a [video game-inspired animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVGbENdQAhc), in early 2022. The goal is to create a functional game using JavaScript based on the entire animation. I've been working on and off on the first part of this, so it is still a work in progress, but I wanted to share what I have so far regardless. I will update this as the project progresses!  

**Languages/Resources Used:**  

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Visual Studio

*All art included is my own. Do not use it for projects, regardless of whether they are personal or professional!*
